Analyzing shark attack incidents worldwide. 

The Shark Research Institute (SRI) maintains a log of shark attacks worldwide. While the purpose of The purpose of SRI is to "use forensic analysis to demonstrate and emphasize the likelihood of shark/human interactions in comparison to the myriad dangers that we face in our daily lives, my goal for working on this project to clean and analyze shark incidents worldwide. Some of the areas of interest in this project are type of incident (provoked or unprovoked), fatalities, the shark species involved and activity/interaction with human.

With a better understanding of these interactions we can minimize the possibility of being injured by a shark, and shift the discussion from fear to conservation of all shark species worldwide.
